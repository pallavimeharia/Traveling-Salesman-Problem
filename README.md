# Traveling-Salesman-Problem

Goal
----

Iteratively determine the least costly traversal path for visiting all nodes from amongst 'n' nodes that have been defined. This is popularly known as the Travelling Salesman Problem. Here, an iterative solution has been designed using C++ which uses Simulated Annealing to compute the traversal cost. The user is required to kill the process manually to stop execution.


Executing the program 
---------------------

* To make the executable, in a terminal, run 'make'
* To run the executable, run: './output_tsp < euclidean_100' [./output_tsp < 'filename']
